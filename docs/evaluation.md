# Evaluating splat quality

`ns-eval` reports PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS on held-out views. Every tuning decision
this pipeline makes has been justified with those three numbers. Four subjective
studies published between 2024 and 2025 measured how well those numbers track
what people see in a Gaussian splat, and the answer is: not well enough
to settle a close call.

This document collects the evidence, says which of our decisions it invalidates,
and proposes what to measure instead.

## What the studies found

Each study collected Mean Opinion Scores from human viewers on a set of
deliberately degraded splats, then asked how well each objective metric
reproduced the human ranking. Numbers below are Spearman rank correlation with
MOS. Higher is better; 1.0 would mean the metric orders stimuli exactly as
people do.

| Metric | 3DGS-VBench | MUGSQA (main) | 3DGS-QA |
|---|---|---|---|
| PSNR | 0.50 | 0.52 | not reported |
| SSIM | 0.51 | 0.37 | 0.31 |
| MS-SSIM | 0.50 | 0.64 | not reported |
| LPIPS | 0.51 | 0.41 (VGG) / 0.44 (Alex) | 0.34 |
| FSIM | 0.59 | 0.68 | not reported |
| IW-SSIM | 0.63 | not reported | not reported |
| CW-SSIM | not reported | 0.74 | not reported |
| DISTS | 0.73 | not reported | not reported |
| BRISQUE | 0.24 | not reported | 0.33 |
| DOVER | **0.94** | not reported | not reported |
| VSFA | **0.94** | not reported | not reported |
| FAST-VQA | **0.93** | not reported | 0.29 |
| DBCNN (fine-tuned) | not reported | **0.88** | not reported |
| GSOQA (fine-tuned) | not reported | not reported | **0.77** |

The three studies disagree on plenty, and they degrade splats in different ways.
They agree on the part that matters here: PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS all land near 0.5
or below, and none of the three separates itself from the other two.

The papers also report Kendall correlation, which converts to something more
concrete. Ignoring ties, a metric with Kendall tau of t orders a random pair of
stimuli the way a human would about (1+t)/2 of the time. On 3DGS-VBench that
puts PSNR at 68%, LPIPS at 68% and DISTS at 76%. On 3DGS-QA, LPIPS drops to 64%.
A coin flip is 50%. When we compare two configurations and one wins on LPIPS,
the odds that a viewer agrees are closer to two in three than to a settled
result.

### What each study degraded

The studies are not interchangeable, and the differences decide which of our
questions they can answer.

**3DGS-VBench** ([2508.07038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07038)) is the one aimed
at delivery. 660 compressed models, 11 scenes, six compression methods at
several parameter levels each, 50 participants scoring rendered videos. This is
the closest published analogue to our own container and pruning decisions.

**MUGSQA** ([2511.06830](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06830)) varies the input
instead: view count (72/36/9), resolution (1080/720/480 square), camera distance
(5 m/2 m/1 m) and point cloud initialisation quality. 1,970 samples from 55
Sketchfab meshes rendered in Blender with exact poses in NeRF-synthetic format.
This is the synthetic ground-truth benchmark we sketched out for ourselves. It
exists, and the code and data are released.

**3DGS-QA** ([2511.08032](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08032)) degrades the
exported asset directly: primitive count reduced to 75/50/25%, positional noise,
spherical harmonic perturbation, plus reduced views and truncated training.
225 models across 15 object types. Its downsampling axis is the nearest thing
in the literature to our cleanup script, with one difference that matters (see
below).

**GS-QA** ([2502.13196](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13196)) is the dissenting
result: correlations above 0.8 for 360-degree scenes, with FSIM and MS-SSIM on
top and ST-LPIPS best on forward-facing scenes. The dissent is explainable. Its
64 stimuli come from eight scenes crossed with seven GS methods plus
Mip-NeRF 360, so the quality range is wide and the comparisons are coarse.
Ranking Scaffold-GS against LightGaussian is not the same problem as ranking two
parameter settings of one method, and the coarse comparison is the one the
metrics handle.

## What this invalidates

**The cap_max sweep.** We measured 100k/250k/500k/1M Gaussians on
`gaudi_fountain` and found PSNR and SSIM blind to the whole range while LPIPS
moved from 0.451 to 0.282. We read that as LPIPS being the sensitive metric.
The correlation numbers say something weaker: LPIPS moved, and we do not know
how much of that motion a viewer would notice. The file size went from 23.8 MB
to 232.9 MB over the same range, so the decision has a real cost on one side and
an unverified benefit on the other.

**The cleanup threshold.** Filtering at opacity 0.05 removes between 4.9% and
62% of the Gaussians depending on the scene. 3DGS-QA measured perceptual cost
for content-blind random pruning at 25/50/75% and found it degrades MOS
smoothly. Our filter is attribute-based, not random: it targets Gaussians the
model itself marked as nearly transparent. Pruning what the model
already considers invisible should cost less than pruning at random, but no
study has measured it. The 62% cases
are the ones to worry about, and we have no evidence either way.

**The container choice.** SPZ against SOG is a quantisation decision applied to
a fixed set of Gaussians. GS-QA evaluates SOG, but as a reconstruction *method*
with spherical harmonics removed during training, not as a container applied
afterwards. Nothing published covers our version of the question.

**The frame-count experiment.** Currently running at 106/212/424 training views
with a pinned held-out set. MUGSQA's view-quantity axis is the closest prior
work, and it also scores with 2D metrics, so it inherits the same ceiling. The
experiment is still worth reading, but a small LPIPS delta between 212 and 424
should not decide anything.

## What to measure instead

3DGS-VBench benchmarked five no-reference video quality models on compressed
splats and found DOVER, VSFA and FAST-VQA all above 0.93 Spearman, against 0.51
for the best of PSNR/SSIM/LPIPS. The paper describes no fine-tuning step for
these models, so the numbers appear to be off-the-shelf pretrained weights
applied to rendered videos. That is worth confirming against their code before
leaning on it.

If it holds, the recommendation is cheap to adopt. These models take a video,
need no reference, and we already render orbit videos with `ns-render`. The
change is one more step after export, not a new benchmark.

The proposed experiment, in order:

1. Run DOVER on the orbit renders from the cap_max sweep already on disk. Four
   configurations, one scene, no new training. If DOVER separates them where
   PSNR and SSIM did not, the metric earns its place.
2. Extend to the cleanup threshold sweep, which is the decision with the widest
   per-scene spread and the least published coverage.
3. Only then consider generating our own stimuli. MUGSQA covers the input axes
   and released its data, so the gap worth filling is attribute-based pruning
   and container quantisation at fixed training, which is a much smaller build
   than a full synthetic benchmark.

## Caveats

The correlations above are pooled across content. Predicting an absolute opinion
score across 15 object types is harder than ranking two settings within one
scene, so 0.5 is a lower bound on how much of our problem the metrics miss, not
a direct estimate of how often our A/B comparisons are wrong.

DBCNN at 0.88 and GSOQA at 0.77 are trained or cross-validated on the same
dataset they score. They are not drop-in metrics.

3DGS-QA reports FAST-VQA at 0.29 while 3DGS-VBench reports 0.93. The two
datasets contain different distortions and different content, and neither paper
explains the other's result. Treat the video-metric recommendation as promising
rather than settled until step 1 above runs on our own data.
